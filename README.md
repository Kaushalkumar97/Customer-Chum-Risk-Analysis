## 🔁 Customer Churn Risk Analysis: Predicting Customer Attrition in Banking
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavioral and demographic data, the framework identifies key indicators of churn and enables the development of proactive strategies to retain high-risk customers. The insights derived from this analysis can directly support tailored customer engagement and retention programs.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn — the loss of clients or customers — is a critical KPI in banking and has direct revenue implications. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can anticipate customer churn using historical data and machine learning algorithms. By understanding why customers leave, banks can implement effective, data-driven retention strategies.
***
## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle and includes information on 10,000 customers with 14 variables each. It covers both personal attributes and behavioral indicators relevant to churn prediction.
### Key Features Include:
- `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, `EstimatedSalary`
- `Geography`, `Gender`, `NumOfProducts`, `IsActiveMember`, `HasCrCard`
- `Exited`: Target variable (1 = churned, 0 = retained)
***
## 🧰 Libraries Used
- Pandas, NumPy – Data handling and wrangling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – ML models, metrics, pipelines
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) – Handling class imbalance
***
## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
To ensure model accuracy, data cleaning and preprocessing were performed:
- Dropped non-informative columns (`RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`)
- Renamed the target column (`Exited` → `ChurnedOrNot`)
- Encoded categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding)
- Verified absence of null values and duplicates
***
## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations revealed meaningful trends:
- Age and Balance: Older customers with higher balances were more likely to churn
- Geography: Churn rate varied significantly across regions
- IsActiveMember: Inactivity had a strong correlation with churn
- Charts used: Box plots, bar graphs, pie charts, correlation matrices
***
## 🏗️ Feature Engineering
- Created new categorical bins for numerical features like Balance and NumOfProducts
- Simplified feature interpretation for models
- Feature distributions were compared across churn vs. non-churn segments
